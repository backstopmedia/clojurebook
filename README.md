# Professional Clojure

These are the code examples included in the book Professional Clojure. The only prerequisite for running the included programs is the Clojure build tool leiningen. Instructions for installing leiningen can be found at https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen. Each of the following directories represents the sample code from an individual chapter of the book, and we used Clojure 1.7.0. You can find more information on the code for each chapter in the invidual README files in each directory.
